Following on from the expansion of the Tic-Tac-Toe game - https://github.com/Lawlor-C/week-7-react-tictactoe-team-threeact-solo-continuation - I wanted to make something from scratch to cement some of the learnings of React that I'd not fully got to grips with during that project.

I've decided on a memory game, knowing that the concept itself is simple but would include quite complex challenges to get around, which seems a perfect way to level-up my knowledge and gain experience as I go.

I'll be leaving full comments in the main jsx files to explain rationale. Once happy with the functionality, I'll be looking to streamline where possible, ie separating concerns into the utils file. This will be done at the final stage, to prevent any unforseen impacts caused by splitting the code out.

To launch, just npm install and npm run dev in the terminal.

As of 3 April, the main game's functionality works as intended, with multiple card sets available. Working on CSS improvements to make it more visually appealing and will then look to adding additional features such as in-game sounds, a score counter, a reset button and the option for the player to choose which card set to use and how many pairs of cards to play with. Currently this is hardcoded within the Gameboard.jsx
